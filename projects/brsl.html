              <h4>Background</h4>
              At the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab, I conducted technical research at the intersection of engineering and international security policy. My work focused on two primary areas: (1) structural and materials analysis of naval reactor pressure vessels for non-proliferation assessments, and (2) evaluation of multi-sensor early-warning systems for counter-UAS applications. Both projects required rigorous technical analysis to inform policy recommendations for high-consequence defense and security environments.
