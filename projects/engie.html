            <ul>
              <li><strong>Relevant Skills</strong>: Energy Systems Analysis, HVAC & Solar Design, Cost–Benefit Analysis, Sustainability Planning, Team Collaboration, Technical Communication</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <h4>Situation</h4>
              In partnership with ENGIE, Livermore High School initiated a multi-system sustainability project to reduce energy costs, modernize facilities, and educate students on renewable energy. The focus areas included <strong>lighting retrofits</strong>, <strong>solar array installation</strong>, and <strong>HVAC upgrades</strong>, supported by an educational outreach campaign to inspire sustainable thinking across the community.
            </p>

            <p>
              <h4>Task</h4>
              The project goals were to:
              <ul>
                <li>Reduce school-wide annual energy consumption through efficiency upgrades.</li>
                <li>Lower operational costs and reinvest savings into education.</li>
                <li>Improve indoor comfort, safety, and learning conditions for students.</li>
                <li>Develop scalable models for other schools and districts to adopt.</li>
                <li>Engage students and the community in sustainability education.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              <h4>Action</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Lighting Retrofit:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Replaced 281 outdated bulbs and installed 220 motion-controlled lights.</li>
                    <li>Improved energy efficiency, reduced glare, and enhanced safety with better illumination.</li>
                    <li>Integrated motion sensors to minimize wasted energy.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Solar Installation:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Constructed three new solar arrays, including a large system in the stadium parking lot.</li>
                    <li>Total capacity: 178.2 kW, providing ~295,465 kWh annually.</li>
                    <li>Reduced reliance on fossil fuels and improved grid resilience with potential for selling excess power.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>HVAC Upgrades:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Replaced outdated transformers with efficient models.</li>
                    <li>Improved heating/cooling efficiency, indoor air quality, and humidity control.</li>
                    <li>Reduced annual energy usage by 78,221 kWh.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Sustainability Education:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Created a video and articles for school and local news outlets to highlight initiatives.</li>
                    <li>Delivered presentations to new Green Engineering Academy (GEA) students to reinforce sustainable thinking.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Result</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Lighting saved ~345,002 kWh/year and $89,380 annually.</li>
                <li>Solar arrays saved $70,403 annually with nearly $700K in 10-year ROI.</li>
                <li>HVAC upgrades saved $18,364 annually, improving comfort and reducing noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Annual Savings:</strong> $178,148.02 (~$1.78M over 10 years).</li>
                <li>Significant reductions in carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              The ENGIE Sustainability Project demonstrated the combined impact of efficiency, renewables, and education. By upgrading lighting, solar, and HVAC systems, Livermore High achieved cost savings, reduced emissions, and improved student well-being. Importantly, the project’s outreach efforts amplified its influence, encouraging sustainable practices within the broader community.
